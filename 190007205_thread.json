I'll start off with an obvious fact that is hopefully well-known now in internet circles:  First Past The Post (FPTP), the most common voting system in Western Democracies, is a giant burning trash pile - and at this point, that's no accident.  TPTB want FPTP to keep power."},

FPTP proponents like it because they think it creates strong majorities in parliament elections with clear mandates.  They are wrong.  Any mandate comes at the cost of removing any choice from voters except the 2 main parties.  3rd party = useless protest vote split, or worse"},

UK 2019, 2016 Republican primaries leading to Trump, Bush-Gore-Nader just the most recent big victims of FPTP.  Yet we can't get rid of it - every referendum is met with huge misinformation/confusion campaigns and change unwanted by both major parties.  No duh why."},

But there are great easy alternatives.  Approval Voting = \"you can just tick multiple boxes, most votes wins\".  Way better.

Range Voting (=\"5 star ratings\") is more mature, since it gives more expression, allowing ppl to rank votes.  Even highly strategic votes just become Approval (0 to enemies, 5 to favorites).

Scores since replicated/improved by: \nhttps://t.co/jdMQtJxcna  Lesson is: maximizing overall Voter Satisfaction is a very good metric for picking the best system.

Another problem is Proof of Identity, where verifying 1 human = 1 vote is difficult online.

A two-party election via web broadcast needs to have a majority of 2/3 if you fear that 1/3 of voters could be DDoSed.  4/5 if you fear 1/5 could be hacked entirely OR DDoSed (best we can do for that).

You get message resistance by giving up something.  Either time - synchronizing votes (brings tolerance back to 1/4 for 3/4 majority).

But - this shit's important because it underlies why we have ugly slow, centralized systems for group decisions.  We're scared of hackers.

Children of Ruin was an amazing follow-up to Children of Time. In particular, I was really happy to see Peter Godfrey-Smith's work on octopuses cited in the CoR acknowledgements after I gushed about it for 10 minutes in the CoT post-read."},

Another good duology closer: Interference by Sue Burke. I really enjoyed the way it explored the world further and stuck with a single generation while still having lots of POVs. Also, the retro-future comms tech was awesome."},

GRRM's harsh stance on fan-fiction created a fan environment that focused on \"theories\" &amp; trying to guess the ending &amp; \"true\" meaning of events, which has created an impossible situation where no ending can ever live up to fan expectations— so don't expect one."},

The Hugo’s “fancasting” category is poorly named, given that almost all nominees and winners work full-time as authors or elsewhere in the SF publishing world. Just call it the podcast category."},

The drop-off in quality between the Hyperion novels (really good!) to the Endymion sequels (utter shite!) is so mind-boggling huge, it’s unlike anything else I’ve ever read."},

One of the best things I ever did was spend a year not reading any novels by white guys.

Soft Apocalypse by Will McIntosh is terribly under-discussed.

I realllly wish that hard cover novels came with a free ebook version (sort of like CDs/records sometimes/used to? do). I would buy a lot more physical books on release if they did. I get why they don’t, however."},

After 2 years as a book podcaster I still don’t know what an “indie” book/author is and based on all the different ways I see that phrase get used, neither does anyone else. \n\nIndie press = useful distinction. Indie book = undetermined, unspecific phrase."},

The overwhelming whiteness and maleness of golden age science fiction was due to an active and conscious campaign of editors like John Campbell and is am utter tragedy.

It is totally valid to not read a work because the author is a piece of shit or the work is problematic in ways you find distasteful, and don’t ever let anyone try to tell you than any book is a “must read” despite those things."},

Alternatively, it is OK to like things that are problematic or written by bad people! An issue lefty critics sometimes face is needing to post-hoc justify things as thematically good because they like them. Nah, you like problematic shit, it’s OK. Just be conscious of it."},

The Steerswoman novels by Rosemary Kirstein are lovely hidden gems that need more attention. The first one was published in the 80s but holds up to any of the best of the new fantasy books of the 2010s. For fans of Vance, Jemisin, Leckie, etc."},

Contact by Carl Sagan is a top-notch first contact novel that is particularly recommended to people who enjoy sociological science fiction, SF that includes religion &amp; religious characters, and SF that is about the scientific process and how that intersects with politics."},

Following authors on twitter is a real Russian roulette. Maybe your fav is a cool person who likes to hang out and will chat with you! Or maybe they’re smug to the point that it actively ruins their books for you. No way to know!"},

I get more annoyed at SF authors who crap on literary authors for writing science fiction without having perfected all the genre conventions than I do literary fiction writers crapping on science fiction for not being literary enough, but ultimately both are dumb."},

Authors don’t get to own their genre or exclude others from it. I get that they want to classify their books and explain their lineage, but critics and readers bear equal responsibility in defining genres and grouping books that they think are like each other."},

I find it boring when future-setting SF doesn't have religion in it. Come on man, shared beliefs &amp; rituals are some of the main drivers of humanity!

I am still upset at the way the Hugos Losers Party fiasco was handled and even more upset that we let it get swept under the rug.

Ship-based science fiction almost always copies the hierarchy of military vessels and it’s a bummer. More ships where the captain has no authority, they are simply responsible for the mental health of their crew. Ships which function as communes or anarchy!"},

Star Trek TNG is still my favorite SF TV show ever produced. ST:TOS is the closest second. \n\nA corollary: for all I love SF books &amp; movies, I've never really gotten into SF TV.

Wittgenstein's Mistress by David Markson is one of the most mind-bending novels I've ever read. Reading it was like watching 2001: A Space Odyssey the first time.

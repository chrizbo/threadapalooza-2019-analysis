It isn’t. The current state is a return to a world lacking a consensual shared media reality."},

We don’t live in interesting times. US origin story is a ship full of kooks sailing West because they were too extreme for both England and Holland."},

Internet platforms modeled themselves on industry without considering the distribution of facts."},

Tribalism used to require real commitment. Now you get tribalism for the lulz. It’s free and it’s abundant."},

The internet platforms quickly drew the ire of the losing side. All of a sudden, the narrative is information wars and radicalized youth."},

I don’t have a great thesis, but it seems relevant that after the repeal of the FCC Fairness doctrine in short order you get Rush Limbaugh, Fox News and Alex Jones."},

Probably a lot to unpack there."},

It’s often mainstream publications like the NYT giving new life to a YouTube video with less than 100k views because it furthers their narrative that the right is radicalizing."},

Naïve algorithms tuned for engagement won’t take that risk."},

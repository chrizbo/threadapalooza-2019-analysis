How many moves it takes to become a nomad depends a lot on your support structures and how you use them. Moving across the world with a plan to move back to your hometown eventually? You’ll probably just think the new place is cool and weird and different."},

In the USA I saw how things were somewhat differently fucked up in every city/state but it took getting away to see the deep roots the issues shared."},

If you don’t acknowledge that you have emotional/social needs, you won’t figure out how to meet them until you finally have to confront and diagnose your discomfort."},

If your travel style is asocial, then you’ll eventually get bored of traveling. Why go somewhere for just a change of scenery? If you hear a rowdy crew of English brothers in their sixties, buy a round and listen to some stories!"},

After spending a month back in the US, what  struck me was the wasted possibilities. I felt a pull to have space again - a workshop - but I had to remind myself that it’s not the space, or the tools that bring results. Figure out what is your core and bring only that with you."},

I’m white. I have an MBA. I get called an “expat” instead of an “economic migrant”. I get special or unique treatment everywhere I go.

Europe and the USA better figure out how to get things done if we want to stay competitive in the next century. American infrastructure is crumbling next to Holland, and Holland seems... limited compared to cities in Asia."}

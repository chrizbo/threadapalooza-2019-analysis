SF combines the worst aspects of city living with the worst parts of living in a suburb: if you have kids, you need a car, housing stock is scarce, costs are astronomical. Day-to-day is harder."},

(*outside* the city) It‚Äôs definitely close to amazing hiking and camping and surfing. California wilderness is beautiful and we love it. While it‚Äôs great, it‚Äôs more a broader Bay Area perk. Live outside SF and go hiking."},

There‚Äôs almost no new construction. The incompetent city govt resists upzoning."},

SF, by contrast, is 115k out of 880k: 13%. Lowest percentage in the country.\n\nTo me, that‚Äôs a sign of a city that‚Äôs failing it‚Äôs residents. Most people have to leave to have a family."},

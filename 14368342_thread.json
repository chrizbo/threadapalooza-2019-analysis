Another feelings/reason link: Intuition is the application of feelings to reasoning, and intuition is key to good reasoning. One of the biggest differences between a mathematician and a theorem prover is that the mathematician has feelings, so can prioritise what feels right."},

One reason to get better at int{erocep}{rospec}tion is that sensing is very much an active part of the process of feeling. Regardless of how constructed emotions are, what you do influences how you feel, and examining your emotional state is part of what you do."},

Indeed, we think of using poetry to explore your emotional state as childish - a thing done by angsty teens. Actually we label *most* strong expressions of emotions as childish. Perhaps because childhood is the last time we weren't constantly suppressing our emotions?"},

My suspicion is that writing poetry is actually easier to fix than reading it, and that people should write more angsty poetry, with no intention of sharing it with others.

I think the childishness thing points to a big problem that I hadn't really verbalised before this thread actually: There's a strong cultural notion that having emotions is childish and/or shameful (and, for men, also shameful because emotions are treated as feminine)."},

I guess it's getting to time to wrap up this thread, so some closing remarks: I don't really know what to do about any of this.

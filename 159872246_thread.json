That means being vulnerable, something I admit a lot of 20 year olds are hormonally challenged by (desire to be liked &gt; earned self-assurance). But if you honestly like something, decent people will respect you for it (or more likely, simply not care)."},

And shoutout b) weight training at your local gym. Contrary to your perception in high school and college, the gym is not the exclusive domain of meatheads. It's a deeply rewarding place that simulates our ancestral environment where you pick up heavy things many times."},

To hesitant females: you will not \"accidentally get bulky\". People train intensely for years to barely attain bodybuilder physique. You will only get more toned, look sexier, and feel better. You don't drive to NYC and \"accidentally land on Moon\""},

I know that sexlessness can be overwhelming in the desperation and frustration it imparts. But interacting with others for the sole objective of having sex is generally *very* off-putting.

You can work on any of these."},

For women, sex is a much easier affair (I'm proceeding on the solidly-researched grounds of sex differences). Physical appearance is your primary constraint, but you could, on avg, sleep with 70%+ of unmarried (and some of the married) men at most bars with minimal effort."},

The reason there are few (any?) female incels is because sex is not the limiting factor of their happiness.

The gaping hole needs addressing. I could have said this earlier but to quote a wise but forgotten tweet: Your parents fucked you up. It's ok, or maybe it isn't, but regardless, go see a therapist. Find out how. Learn to be gentle with yourself."}

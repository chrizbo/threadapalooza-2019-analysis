It's become well known Crowds can in some circumstances aggregate information stunningly accurately.\n\nAn illustrative anecode is Sir Francis Galton's surprise that the crowd at a county fair accurately guessed the weight of an ox when their individual guesses were averaged."},

What is less well known is that the mechanism of aggregation matters. \n\nYou might aggregate the information through voting or perhaps a market.\n\nIt can be as simple as asking many people to cross a park, a clear convenient beaten path emerges from their individual behavior."},

Crowds aren't inherently creative, they are well understood as very agressive hill climbing mechanisms. They will be terrible at crossing adaptive valleys."},

Because of this machine learning partially obsoletes the traditional mechanisms of aggregation. \n\nMachine learning on big data gathered through mass surveilance pushes against both voting and markets. \n\nIt enthrones revealed preferences. Whatever moves your behavior, will!"},

Spot the interesting assumption? \n\nYou can go very far by analyzing crowds as a tool. Crowds don't set agendas, rather they respond to them.\n\nThe task of leadership has always been to use social technology to harness crowds."},

Speech giving might be seems as a purely passive activity. One where you are pleasing a crowd. \n\nConsider that reading crowds is on of the few ways we can naturally take information about hundreds of people in.\n\nAn audience when gathered opens themselves up for surveilance."},

A good reality check on the intelligence of crowds is that a hierarchical military unit easily defeats mobs in combat. \n\nAnd this points to an important strength and weakness: Crowds never implement processes or multi step plans. \n\nA military unit might!"},

A natural and surprisingly scaleable method of aggregation is imitation of movement.\n\nThe movement of people, and hence their emotions are synchronized. A kind of trance.\n\nWe can see this induced in regimented manner in armies. But also infectiously in mobs and yes cities."},

The role of crowds in cities isn't well understood. \n\nI would go as far as to say that you don't have a real city without mass gatherings and that it might be main acculturation engine.\n\nAncient Greek Theater and the NYC subway both permanently socially alter participants."},

Now let's move away from the internal dynamics of crowds to effects of massed attention.\n\nEric S. Raymond suggested that given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow.

Massed crowd attention is damaging to individuals. \n\nForget mechanism, think about the evidence.

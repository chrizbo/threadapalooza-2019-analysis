Given all the dietary changes I’ve made for myself over the last year (intermittent fasting, low carb, more protein and healthy fats) it was a bit jarring to see how difficult it was  to maintain that over there."},

For those not in the know that is a challenging thing to do because everyone will try to feed you endlessly when you visit."},

Combo of 5 or 6 different things, usually a mix of nuts or some sort of processed fried carb snack/crackers/biscuit. It’s just designed to make you overeat."},

Indian sweets are essentially concentrated diabetes."},

Supposedly could be a genetic thing but my gut tells me the diet may play a bigger role."},

Granted beef wasn’t super widely available (at least as far as I could tell), but was surprising to hear they outright banned consumption. Apparently it’s still cool to export it though."},

If they banned chicken the whole country would probably riot."},

So much so that I can’t really enjoy Indian food back here in the US."},

In the context of Indian food in the US, I tend to agree.  At least for North Indian/Punjabi food."},

Granted I probably don’t have the same level of discernment for South Indian food as North Indian food so maybe take that with a grain of salt."},

Just need a slow cooker, whole chicken, tandoori paste, and yogurt and you’re all set. https://t.co/Nhtg6JxZS7"},

Personally I think haldi ka doodh (turmeric milk) is kinda gross, but if you’re really feeling up for it sure, appropriate to your heart’s content."},

If anyone does happen to know of such a place please do let me know."}
